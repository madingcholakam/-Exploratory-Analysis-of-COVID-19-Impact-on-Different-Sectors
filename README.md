Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains datasets, scripts, and visualizations for an exploratory data analysis project. The data analysis process utilizes Microsoft Excel for initial exploration and summarization and R for advanced statistical analysis and visualization.

Dataset: EDA.xlsx

Overview

The Excel file consists of multiple sheets with distinct purposes:

Pivot Table: Aggregated counts and summary tables derived from the dataset.

Exploratory Analysis: Detailed initial data exploration, trends, and patterns.

Calculations: Derived metrics and formulas used in the analysis.

Visualizations: Charts and graphs created to represent key insights.

Key Features

Survey Responses: Includes questions and aggregated counts of responses across multiple categories.

Location-Based Analysis: Data segmented by areas such as "Kakuma Town" and "Kakuma 1".

Change Metrics: Variables representing changes over time (e.g., "reduced slightly" or "stopped completely").

R Script: analysis.R

Purpose

The R script complements the Excel analysis with:

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the raw data for analysis.

Advanced Statistics: Hypothesis testing, regression modeling, or clustering.

Visualization: Creating publication-ready plots using libraries like ggplot2.

Key Features

Reads data directly from EDA.xlsx using readxl.

Performs exploratory analysis with summary statistics and correlation matrices.

Generates visualizations such as bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

How to Use This Repository

Prerequisites

Microsoft Excel (or equivalent) for viewing and editing .xlsx files.

R (v4.0 or later) and the following R libraries:

readxl: For importing Excel data.

dplyr: For data manipulation.

ggplot2: For data visualization.

Running the Analysis

Open EDA.xlsx to review the initial data and pivot tables.

Run analysis.R to perform advanced statistical analysis and generate visualizations:

R

Copy code

# Load required libraries

library(readxl)

library(dplyr)

library(ggplot2)

# Execute analysis

source("scripts/analysis.R")

Outputs

Generated visualizations and insights are saved in the outputs/ folder.

Summary statistics and key findings are documented in the scripts/ or accompanying Markdown reports.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the analysis or want to add features, feel free to submit a pull request.
